# Bolt Runtime Protocol

**Document ID:** RUNTIME-015
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** Defines how a Bolt is executed end-to-end in the AI Engineering System

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the **operational runtime behavior** of a Bolt.

It answers:

> How does a Bolt actually move through the system in practice?

This is the missing bridge between:
- workflow design
- and real execution

---

# 2. Core Principle

A Bolt is executed as a **strict state machine with controlled agent handoffs**.

No agent may skip steps.

No state transition is implicit.

All transitions must be logged.

---

# 3. Execution Model

Each Bolt follows this execution sequence:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

BOLT[Bolt Created] --> PLANNER[Planner Execution]
PLANNER --> ARCH[Architect Validation]
ARCH --> EM_APPROVAL[EM Approval]

EM_APPROVAL --> ASSIGN[Assignment]

ASSIGN --> DEV[Implementation Agent]
DEV --> TESTER[Tester Agent]
TESTER --> REVIEWER[Reviewer Agent]

REVIEWER -->|Approved| ACCEPTED[Accepted]
ACCEPTED --> PO_CLOSE[Product Owner Closure]
REVIEWER -->|Rework| DEV
```

---

# 4. Bolt State Machine

```mermaid

Draft --> Planned
Planned --> ArchitectReview
ArchitectReview --> Approved
Approved --> Assigned
Assigned --> InProgress
InProgress --> Testing
Testing --> Review
Review --> Rework
Review --> Accepted
Accepted --> Closed
```

---

# 5. Runtime Execution Rules

## RULE R1 — Strict Sequential Execution

A Bolt MUST pass through:

1. Planner
2. Architect
3. Engineering Manager approval
4. Assignment
5. Implementation
6. Tester
7. Reviewer
8. Product Owner closure

No step may be skipped.

---

## RULE R2 — Single Active State

A Bolt MUST always be in exactly ONE state.

No parallel conflicting states allowed.

---

## RULE R3 — Agent Isolation

Each agent:

- Only operates within its assigned phase
- Cannot modify other phases’ outputs
- Cannot skip validation layers

---

## RULE R4 — Logging Requirement

Every transition MUST generate a log entry:

```yaml
timestamp: UTC
bolt_id: BOLT-XXX
agent: <agent_name>
from_state: <state>
to_state: <state>
event: <description>
```

Stored in:
`docs/agents-log.md`

---

## RULE R5 — Tester as Gatekeeper

A Bolt CANNOT proceed to Reviewer unless:

- All acceptance criteria are executed
- Test report exists
- No critical failures remain unresolved

---

## RULE R6 — Reviewer as Final Technical Gate

Reviewer decision is final technical validation:

- APPROVED → Bolt transitions to Accepted
- REWORK → returns to Implementation
- REJECTED → escalates to EM

---

## RULE R7 — Product Owner is the Closure Authority

Only the Product Owner can:

- mark Bolt as CLOSED
- accept final product outcome
- finalize lifecycle closure

The Engineering Manager coordinates closure readiness and records metrics after Product Owner acceptance.

---

# 6. Runtime Execution Phases

---

## Phase 1 — Planning Runtime

Executed by Planner:

- Decompose intent into Bolt structure
- Define acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies
- Output: Draft Bolt

---

## Phase 2 — Architecture Runtime

Executed by Architect:

- Validate feasibility
- Check system design consistency
- Approve or reject Bolt

---

## Phase 3 — EM Approval Runtime

Executed by Engineering Manager:

- Confirm completeness
- Ensure readiness for execution
- Assign implementation agents

---

## Phase 4 — Implementation Runtime

Executed by:
- Backend Agent
- Frontend Agent
- DevOps Agent

Rules:
- Must follow Bolt scope only
- Must not modify acceptance criteria
- Must log implementation decisions

---

## Phase 5 — Testing Runtime

Executed by Tester:

- Validate acceptance criteria
- Execute test cases
- Generate test report
- Output PASS/FAIL

---

## Phase 6 — Review Runtime

Executed by Reviewer:

- Validate architecture compliance
- Validate code quality
- Validate test coverage
- Decide outcome

---

## Phase 7 — Closure Runtime

Executed by Product Owner, coordinated by EM:

- Confirm Tester + Reviewer approval
- Accept final outcome
- Close Bolt
- Record metrics through EM
- Finalize logs

---

# 7. Failure Handling Model

---

## 7.1 Implementation Failure

→ Returns to Implementation

---

## 7.2 Test Failure

→ Returns to Implementation

Tester must:
- log failure
- specify reproduction steps

---

## 7.3 Review Failure

→ Returns to Implementation OR EM escalation

---

## 7.4 Architectural Failure

→ Returns to Planner or Architect depending on severity

---

# 8. Event Model (System Truth Layer)

Every runtime action emits an event:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "UTC",
  "bolt_id": "BOLT-001",
  "agent": "Tester",
  "event_type": "STATE_TRANSITION",
  "from": "InProgress",
  "to": "Testing",
  "message": "All test cases executed successfully"
}
```

---

# 9. Model Comparison Support (IMPORTANT)

This runtime protocol is designed to be:

> model-agnostic

Meaning:

- same Bolt
- same workflow
- same evaluation criteria
- different model → different outcomes

This enables:

- branch-based comparison (your git strategy)
- reproducibility of results
- structured benchmarking

---

# 10. EM Dashboard Integration

Every runtime transition MUST update:

- Bolt state in dashboard
- agent activity panel
- blocker panel (if applicable)
- timeline metrics

---

# 11. Success Criteria for Runtime System

The runtime system is valid if:

- Every Bolt can be executed end-to-end
- No step is ambiguous
- No agent bypass occurs
- All transitions are logged
- Tester + Reviewer enforce correctness independently

---

# 12. Philosophy

This runtime system defines:

> “Software engineering as a deterministic state machine operated by specialized agents.”

It transforms development from:
- human-driven coordination

into:
- structured agent execution pipeline
