### Planner Agent

Status

Planned

Bolt

BOLT-001

State Transition

Draft -> Planned

Artifacts

- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Created the first implementation Bolt from the approved baseline: BOLT-001 Authentication Core. Scope includes the minimum required Angular, NestJS, Firebase Auth, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and REST scaffolding for authentication; backend Firebase ID token validation and user mapping; frontend login, registration, logout, password reset, and Google Sign-In integration; and testable acceptance criteria for FR-AUTH-001 through FR-AUTH-006 and AC-001 through AC-004. No implementation agents were assigned.

Scope Decisions

- Included backend and frontend authentication in one vertical slice because BOLT-001 is the foundation for persisted user identity.
- Limited implementation scaffolding to what is necessary for authentication because no implementation directories exist yet.
- Excluded gameplay, puzzle retrieval, attempts, statistics, leaderboards, production deployment, and agent assignment.

Splitting Decision

Kept as one L-complexity Bolt because the approved development plan defines BOLT-001 as Authentication Core spanning Firebase integration, backend auth validation, and user creation; splitting would create artificial dependencies before a working identity foundation exists.

Escalations

None. No blocking ambiguity was found.

Related Requirement IDs

US-001, US-002, US-003, FR-AUTH-001, FR-AUTH-002, FR-AUTH-003, FR-AUTH-004, FR-AUTH-005, FR-AUTH-006, AC-001, AC-002, AC-003, AC-004, NFR-SEC-001, NFR-SEC-002, NFR-SEC-003, NFR-SEC-004, BR-010

Next Suggested Task

### Architect Agent

Status

Approved for architecture readiness

Bolt

BOLT-001

State Transition

Planned -> ArchitectReview

Artifacts

- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Validated BOLT-001 Authentication Core against the approved architecture, data model, API specification, conventions, traceability matrix, open questions, and ADR-002 through ADR-008. The Bolt preserves identity/authentication boundaries, keeps Firebase as the credential authority, stores only application user metadata in PostgreSQL through Prisma, uses the documented REST `/api/v1/auth/me` contract and response envelope, keeps Angular presentation/session concerns separate from NestJS application logic, and follows feature-first frontend/backend structure.

Follow-up Actions

- Engineering Manager approval is still required before the Bolt can move to Approved.
- Implementation agents must keep authentication scaffolding limited to BOLT-001 scope and must not introduce gameplay, leaderboard, statistics, puzzle, or deployment behavior.

State Transition

Approved -> Assigned

Artifacts

- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Reason

Assigned implementation to Backend Agent and Frontend Agent, testing to Tester Agent, and technical review to Reviewer Agent. Work must remain limited to BOLT-001 authentication scope and must not introduce gameplay, puzzle, statistics, leaderboard, deployment, or unrelated architecture changes.

Escalation

None.

Next Suggested Task

BOLT-001

State Transition

Assigned -> InProgress

Artifacts

- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Reason

Started BOLT-001 implementation after EM assignment. Backend Agent owns backend authentication, Prisma user mapping, and protected API behavior. Frontend Agent owns Angular authentication UI, Firebase client integration, and protected API token attachment. Both agents must remain within authentication scope.

Escalation

None.

Next Suggested Task

Backend Agent and Frontend Agent complete implementation outputs for Tester validation.

### Backend Implementation Agent

Status

Completed

Bolt

BOLT-001

State Transition

InProgress -> InProgress

Artifacts

- backend/**

Summary

Implemented backend authentication scaffold with NestJS modules, Firebase bearer-token validation boundary, Prisma-backed User mapping, `GET /api/v1/auth/me` envelope behavior, User schema/migration/seed, and deterministic auth/user mapping specs.

Validation

- `npm test -- --runInBand` initially failed inside the sandbox because Supertest could not bind a local listener (`listen EPERM`).
- `npm test -- --runInBand` passed outside the sandbox: 2 test suites, 6 tests.
- `npm run build` passed.

Follow-up Actions

- Configure real Firebase Admin and PostgreSQL environment variables before runtime use.
- Review npm audit findings before production deployment.

Bolt

BOLT-001

State Transition

InProgress -> InProgress

Artifacts

- frontend/**

Summary

Implemented frontend authentication scaffold with Angular standalone routes, Firebase client boundary, auth state/token retrieval, protected route guard, API bearer-token interceptor, login/register/password-reset/Google/logout UI, and deterministic frontend specs.

Validation

- `npm install` initially failed once with Angular peer dependency drift; Angular packages were pinned to `20.3.25`.
- `npm install` then failed once with npm registry DNS/network errors and passed on retry.
- `npm test -- --watch=false` initially failed 2 interceptor specs due async test timing; specs were patched.
- `npm test -- --watch=false` passed: 15 tests.
- `npm run build` failed inside the sandbox with exit code 134, then passed outside the sandbox.

Follow-up Actions

- Configure real Firebase client environment values before runtime use.
- Review npm audit findings before production deployment.

BOLT-001

State Transition

Testing -> Review

Artifacts

- docs/test-reports/BOLT-001-test-report.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Validated BOLT-001 Authentication Core acceptance criteria AC-1 through AC-12 against the backend and frontend implementation, automated tests, API contract, architecture constraints, testing strategy, conventions, and observed command evidence. Overall result is PASS with no critical or major failures. Backend Firebase token validation, protected `/api/v1/auth/me` behavior, user mapping idempotency, duplicate username handling, Prisma uniqueness/UTC timestamp model, frontend Firebase auth flows, password reset, logout behavior, route guard, and bearer-token interceptor are covered.

Validation

- Backend `npm test -- --runInBand` passed outside sandbox: 2 suites, 6 tests.
- Backend `npm run build` passed.
- Frontend `npm test -- --watch=false` passed: 15 tests.
- Frontend `npm run build` passed outside sandbox.
- Initial sandbox-only failures were environment limitations: backend Supertest local listener `listen EPERM`; frontend build exit code 134.

Follow-up Actions

- Reviewer Agent should perform technical review.
- Address npm audit findings before production deployment: backend 29 vulnerabilities, frontend 12 vulnerabilities.
- Future E2E/live-provider validation should exercise real Firebase and PostgreSQL configuration outside BOLT-001 scope.

State Transition

Review -> Rework

Artifacts

- docs/review-reports/BOLT-001-review.md
- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Completed final technical review for BOLT-001. Backend authentication architecture, Firebase bearer-token validation, protected `/api/v1/auth/me` behavior, Prisma user mapping model, response envelopes, and feature-first conventions are generally compliant. Review found one major acceptance gap: successful frontend registration and Google Sign-In flows do not call the protected backend profile endpoint or otherwise trigger backend application `User` mapping, so AC-1 and AC-5 are not satisfied by the submitted flow.

Decision

REQUIRES REWORK.

Required Follow-up Actions

- Hydrate/map the backend application user profile after successful registration and Google Sign-In.
- Add deterministic frontend coverage proving those flows trigger the protected backend mapping call with the Firebase ID token.
- Return BOLT-001 to Testing after rework.

- frontend/src/app/authentication/services/auth-state.service.spec.ts
- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Resolved Reviewer rework by hydrating the backend application user profile after successful Firebase registration, email/password login, and Google Sign-In before routing to the dashboard. Added deterministic service tests proving registration, login, and Google Sign-In trigger `ApiClientService.getCurrentUserProfile()`, which exercises the protected `/api/v1/auth/me` mapping path through the existing interceptor.

Validation

- Frontend `npm test -- --watch=false` passed: 15 tests.
- Frontend `npm run build` passed outside sandbox.
- Backend `npm test -- --runInBand` passed outside sandbox: 2 suites, 6 tests.
- Backend `npm run build` passed.

Escalation

None.

Next Suggested Task

Tester Agent revalidates BOLT-001 after rework.

State Transition

Testing -> Review

Artifacts

- docs/test-reports/BOLT-001-test-report.md
- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Revalidated BOLT-001 after Reviewer-requested rework. Confirmed the previous AC-1 and AC-5 gap is closed: frontend registration, email/password login, and Google Sign-In now call the protected backend profile mapping path through `ApiClientService.getCurrentUserProfile()` before dashboard navigation. No implementation code was modified during testing.

Validation

- Frontend `npm test -- --watch=false` passed locally: 15 tests.
- Backend `npm test -- --runInBand` passed locally: 2 suites, 6 tests.
- Frontend `npm run build` passed locally.
- Backend `npm run build` passed locally.
- Static validation confirmed `AuthStateService` calls `getCurrentUserProfile()` after successful Firebase registration, login, and Google Sign-In, and existing interceptor coverage verifies `Authorization: Bearer <firebase_id_token>` is attached to `/api/v1/auth/me`.

Follow-up Actions

- Reviewer Agent should perform the rework technical review.
- Future E2E/live-provider validation should exercise real Firebase and PostgreSQL configuration outside BOLT-001 scope.

- docs/bolts/BOLT-001-authentication-core.md
- docs/agents-log.md

Summary

Completed final re-review after Frontend Implementation Agent rework and Tester Agent PASS. Confirmed the previous blocker is closed: successful registration, email/password login, and Google Sign-In now call `ApiClientService.getCurrentUserProfile()` before dashboard navigation, triggering the protected `/api/v1/auth/me` backend application user mapping path after Firebase authentication.

Decision

APPROVED.

Follow-up Actions

- Engineering Manager may proceed from Accepted toward Product Owner closure.
- Future E2E/live-provider validation should exercise real Firebase and PostgreSQL configuration outside BOLT-001 scope.
- Triage npm audit findings before production deployment.

Summary

Clarified Reviewer rework handoff behavior after observing that Reviewer-requested rework was applied directly by the orchestrator. Updated workflow, runtime protocol, Reviewer and Engineering Manager specifications, runnable prompts, and review report template so REQUIRES REWORK transitions to Rework, hands off to Engineering Manager for triage, and is assigned back to the responsible Backend, Frontend, or DevOps implementation agent before returning to Testing.

Next Suggested Task

Use the updated Reviewer handoff rule for all future Bolt rework loops.
